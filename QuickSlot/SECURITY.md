# QuickSlot Extension - Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements implemented in the QuickSlot Chrome extension to address potential security vulnerabilities and follow best practices for browser extension security.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Token Scope Validation (getUserInfo Enhancement)

**Issue**: The extension needed to validate OAuth token scopes to ensure proper permissions.

**Implementation**:
- Added comprehensive token scope validation in `validateToken()` method
- Validates required scopes: `calendar.readonly` and `userinfo.email`
- Checks for unexpected/unauthorized scopes
- Logs security violations for monitoring
- Handles insufficient scope errors gracefully

**Benefits**:
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks
- Ensures the extension only has necessary permissions
- Provides audit trail for scope violations

### 2. Enhanced Input Validation and Sanitization

**Issue**: Attendee email inputs could be vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Implementation**:
- Added `sanitizeInput()` method to remove dangerous characters
- Enhanced email validation with RFC 5321 compliance
- Added suspicious domain detection (IP addresses, localhost, Tor domains)
- Implemented email masking for privacy in logs
- Added duplicate email detection
- Limited attendees to maximum of 50 to prevent abuse

**Security Features**:
```javascript
// Removes potentially dangerous patterns
- HTML/script injection characters: `<>'"` 
- JavaScript protocols: `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`
- Event handlers: `on*=` patterns
- Length validation (max 320 characters per RFC 5321)
- Consecutive dots validation
- Start/end dot validation
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents XSS and injection attacks through email inputs
- Maintains data integrity
- Provides user privacy through email masking
- Prevents abuse through input limits

### 3. Background Script Security Enhancement

**Issue**: Background script needed protection against malicious message requests.

**Implementation**:
- Added sender validation to prevent unauthorized requests
- Implemented rate limiting (10 requests per minute per sender)
- Enhanced token validation with format and content checks
- Added suspicious pattern detection for tokens
- Improved error handling and logging

**Security Checks**:
```javascript
// Token format validation
- Length validation (20-2048 characters)
- Content pattern detection for malicious code
- Sender origin validation
- Rate limiting per sender ID
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents DoS attacks through message flooding
- Validates token authenticity and format
- Blocks potentially malicious token content
- Maintains audit trail of security events

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP) Enhancement

**Issue**: Basic CSP needed strengthening against various attack vectors.

**Implementation**:
Updated manifest.json CSP to include:
- `base-uri 'self'` - Prevents base tag hijacking
- `form-action 'self'` - Restricts form submissions
- `frame-ancestors 'none'` - Prevents clickjacking
- `upgrade-insecure-requests` - Forces HTTPS

**Benefits**:
- Comprehensive protection against XSS attacks
- Prevents clickjacking and frame-based attacks
- Enforces secure communication protocols
- Reduces attack surface area

### 5. Advanced Token Management

**Issue**: Token handling needed additional security layers.

**Implementation**:
- Pre-API call token validation with scope checking
- Email verification status checking
- Cross-validation between token info and user info APIs
- Enhanced token refresh logic with security checks
- Secure token storage and cleanup

**Security Features**:
- Token expiration monitoring (5-minute preemptive refresh)
- Email verification requirement enforcement
- Cross-API email matching validation
- Secure token masking in logs

**Benefits**:
- Prevents use of expired or invalid tokens
- Ensures user email verification
- Detects token manipulation attempts
- Maintains secure audit trails

### 6. Privacy and Data Protection

**Implementation**:
- Email masking in all log outputs
- Sensitive data sanitization before display
- Personal information protection in error messages
- Secure token truncation for logging

**Features**:
```javascript
// Email masking example
"user@example.com" → "us***@example.com"

// Token masking example  
"ya29.a0AfH6..." → "ya29.a0AfH6... (20 chars shown)"
```

**Benefits**:
- Protects user privacy in logs and error messages
- Complies with data protection requirements
- Reduces sensitive data exposure risk
- Maintains security without compromising functionality

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Extension requests only necessary permissions
- OAuth scopes limited to required APIs only
- Background script validates all requests

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple validation layers for all inputs
- Client-side and API-level security checks
- Redundant authentication verification

### 3. Secure by Default
- Strict CSP policy by default
- Input sanitization applied universally
- Rate limiting enabled for all message handlers

### 4. Privacy by Design
- Sensitive data masking in all contexts
- Minimal data collection and storage
- Secure token handling throughout lifecycle

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events Logged
- Token scope validation failures
- Input sanitization events
- Suspicious domain detection
- Rate limiting violations
- Authentication anomalies
- Token manipulation attempts

### Log Security Features
- Sensitive data masking
- Structured security event format
- Error context without sensitive details
- Performance impact monitoring

## Future Security Recommendations

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Quarterly code security reviews
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Token scope requirement validation

### 2. Enhanced Monitoring
- Security event alerting system
- User behavior anomaly detection
- API usage pattern monitoring

### 3. User Security Education
- Security best practices documentation
- Phishing awareness for OAuth flows
- Safe email sharing guidelines

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards Followed
- **RFC 5321**: Email format validation
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure token handling
- **Chrome Extension Security**: Manifest V3 best practices
- **OWASP**: Input validation and sanitization guidelines

### Security Testing
- Input validation boundary testing
- Authentication flow security testing
- Token lifecycle security verification
- CSP policy effectiveness validation

## Implementation Verification

To verify the security implementations are working correctly:

1. **Token Validation**: Check browser console for scope validation messages
2. **Input Sanitization**: Test with various malicious email inputs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Rapidly trigger background script messages
4. **CSP**: Attempt to inject inline scripts (should fail)
5. **Privacy**: Verify email masking in console logs
