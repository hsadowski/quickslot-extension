            <div class="subtitle">Privacy Policy - Effective Date: July 19, 2025</div>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div class="intro">
                <p><strong>QuickSlot</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the QuickSlot Chrome Extension ("Extension"). The Extension is a meeting scheduling tool designed for Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) to find available time slots across multiple Google Calendars. By installing or using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Extension.</p>
                
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy here with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the Extension after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide the Extension's functionality. All data processing occurs locally in your browser, and we do not store or transmit data to our servers.</p>
            
            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User's Email Address and Google Account Information:</strong> We retrieve your email address and basic profile information (e.g., name) via Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication process (using the userinfo.email scope). This is required for authentication and to access your Google Calendar.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Attendee Email Addresses:</strong> You may manually enter email addresses of meeting participants to check their calendar availability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Calendar Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free/Busy Information:</strong> We access read-only free/busy data from your Google Calendar and those of entered attendees (using the calendar.readonly scope). This includes time periods when calendars are busy or free, but we do not access event details, content, or descriptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability Windows:</strong> We process busy time periods to identify open slots across multiple calendars.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Preferences and Settings</h3>
            <p><strong>Preferences:</strong> We collect and store your selected meeting duration (e.g., 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes), business hours (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM), specific search dates, and time buffer settings (e.g., avoiding early morning or late afternoon slots). These are used solely to customize availability searches.</p>
            
            <p>We do not collect any other personal data, such as browsing history, location, or device information, beyond what is strictly necessary for the Extension's operation.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected information exclusively for the Extension's core functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meeting Scheduling and Availability Analysis:</strong> To query and process free/busy data from Google Calendars, generate time slot suggestions, and format them for easy copying (e.g., to your clipboard for email use).</li>
                <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> To securely authenticate you via Google OAuth 2.0 and retrieve your email for calendar access.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization:</strong> To apply your preferences (e.g., business hours) to refine search results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, tracking, profiling, data mining, or any commercial purposes. No data is sold, shared, or used beyond the Extension's stated functionality.</p>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
            
            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's extension storage (storage permission):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User preferences (e.g., meeting duration, business hours).</li>
                <li>Temporary OAuth 2.0 authentication tokens.</li>
                <li>Selected search dates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not store calendar content, email addresses, or free/busy data permanently. Data is retained only as long as needed for a session (e.g., tokens are cleared upon sign-out or revocation) or until you clear it via Chrome settings.</p>

            <h3>No Server-Side Storage</h3>
            <p>The Extension does not transmit or store data on any external servers controlled by us. All processing happens locally in your browser. Data is only sent to Google APIs as described below.</p>

            <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google APIs:</strong> We transmit limited data to Google for authentication and functionality:
                    <ul>
                        <li>OAuth 2.0 requests (including tokens and headers).</li>
                        <li>FreeBusy API queries (including date ranges and attendee email addresses).</li>
                        <li>UserInfo API requests (to retrieve your email).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Google's handling of this data is governed by their own privacy policies (available at policies.google.com/privacy). We rely on Google's security practices but cannot control them.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a court order, subpoena, or government request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No other sharing occurs. We do not engage in data sales under CCPA definitions.</p>

            <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
            <p>We prioritize the security of your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Email addresses are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks or suspicious inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Token Management:</strong> OAuth tokens are stored securely, validated automatically, refreshed as needed, and cleared upon revocation. We implement rate limiting and scope validation.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> We use Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS and injection attacks. Sensitive data (e.g., emails) is masked in logs, and there is no persistent storage of calendar details.</li>
                <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> The Extension requests only necessary Chrome permissions (identity for authentication, storage for preferences, activeTab for clipboard access) and host permissions limited to Google's APIs (https://www.googleapis.com/*).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Despite these measures, no system is completely secure. Potential risks include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inference of schedules or patterns from free/busy data.</li>
                <li>Processing of attendee email addresses.</li>
                <li>Temporary local storage of tokens, which could be vulnerable to browser exploits.</li>
                <li>Reliance on Google's API security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We recommend keeping your browser and extension updated.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>You have control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Access to your Google account requires explicit OAuth consent. You can revoke permissions anytime via your Google Account settings (myaccount.google.com/permissions).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Access and Deletion:</strong> View or delete stored preferences through Chrome extension settings (chrome://extensions/). Revoking OAuth access immediately cuts off data retrieval. We retain no data beyond what's in your local storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Uninstall the Extension to stop all data processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Under <strong>GDPR</strong> (if you are in the EU/EEA) or <strong>CCPA</strong> (if you are a California resident):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GDPR Rights:</strong> We process data based on your consent (lawful basis). You have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.</li>
                <li><strong>CCPA Rights:</strong> We do not sell data. California residents may request disclosure of collected data or opt-out of sales (though none occur).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise rights, contact us as detailed below. We will respond within applicable legal timeframes (e.g., 30 days for GDPR, 45 days for CCPA).</p>

            <h2>7. International Data Transfers and Compliance</h2>
            <p>If you are outside the United States, note that data transmitted to Google APIs may be processed in the U.S. or other countries. We comply with data minimization and purpose limitation principles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> We act as a data processor relying on user consent. Data is minimized and used only for scheduling.</li>
                <li><strong>CCPA:</strong> No personal information is sold; collection is limited to functional needs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Extension is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.</p>
